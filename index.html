        <p>Attendance management is basically the record of student’s presence or absence in classes. Attendance system is efficient and also important because it helps to keep track of their presence in classes and also their regularity to classes. Since it has become mandatory, attendance management system is used, which helps in taking the record of attendance of students and storing it for accessing attendance details of students. Student’s attendance report is taken on weekly basis and reports will be generated. It is also used to provide the attendance rate which gives the average percentage (%) of students attending school every day in year. Management can also take necessary steps to increase the attendance rate from the analyzed data.
            So, this attendance management system is created to do required tasks with ease.
