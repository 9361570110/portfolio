        <h1><u>About Us</u></h1><br><br>
        <p>We help our users to create their own blog content and upload it in our webpage. You can Create those blogs from the "Create" option in the navigation bar. It will
            go to another webpage and it will show up the form to fill the details of the Blog you are going to create.We need to start networking with other bloggers in following way:

        </p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Engage with other bloggers on social networks</b> – This can include sharing other people’s content and responding to them in comments of status updates.</li>
                <br><li><b>Leave helpful comments on other blogs</b>– This is best done on personal blogs where the owner responds to comments. This is a sure-fire way to get noticed providing you leave anything promotional out of your comments and focus on leaving helpful comments.</li>
                <br><li><b>Become part of a thriving community in your niche</b>– Online communities are a great way to connect with other bloggers. From Sub-Reddit’s to Facebook Groups and forums, there’s plenty to choose from.
                </li>
                <br><li><b>Use an email provider instead of a feed delivery service</b> – Using an email provider like MailChimp means you can send out emails to your subscribers whenever you like and you get much more control over how emails look. You also get better analytics and can create sequences of emails that new subscribers will receive, otherwise known as auto responders. Be sure to check out my comparison of popular email marketing services.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Offer something for free in exchange for email addresses</b> – Your audience has a problem and your goal is to solve it so this is a great opportunity to put together a free resource for your readers. It could be a checklist, guide, template or even a tool.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Make it easy for people to subscribe </b>– Give your audience plenty of opportunities to subscribe. This means adding opt-in forms to strategic locations. Email capture tools like Thrive Leads are super effective.</li>
                    <br><li><b>
                        Add a follow button to your confirmation page</b> – When someone confirms their subscription to your email list, they’ll be sent to a confirmation page. This is a great opportunity to add a Facebook Like box, Twitter follow button or something else.
                        <br><li><b>Invite your subscribers within a welcome email </b>– When new subscribers join your list, they should get a welcome email telling them what to expect from you. With MailChimp you can send a “final welcome email” using a free account which does the job, for other email providers you may have to add this manually using their auto responder feature. This is as simple as asking them to join you on your favorite social network.</li>
                        <br><li><b>Create a special email for your auto responder sequence</b> – Most email providers have the option to create an auto responder sequence. Similar to the welcome email, you could add another email later which encourages subscribers to follow your social profiles. How you introduce this is up to you, you could use a “getting to know you” type email or just add it to the next email in your sequence.</li>

                    </li>
                    <br><li>
                        <b>Be accessible </b>– Being unreachable is something often done in business, but it shouldn’t be done with a blog, even if your blog is a business. Make yourself available, starting with adding a contact page for anyone wanting to get in touch. And always avoid sending emails to your subscribers from a “noreply” style email.</li>
                           <br><li><b> Respond to your readers</b> – The more readers you have, the more difficult this is but it’s important to do. Whether through commenting or emails, responding to your readers needs to be done
